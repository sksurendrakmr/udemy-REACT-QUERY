# React Query in Larger App

- Centralizing fetching indicator / error handling
- refetching data
- integrating auth
- dependent queries
- testing

# Custom Hooks

- In larger app, make custom hook for each type of data
  --> can access from multiple components
  --> no risk of mixing up keys
  --> query function encapsulated in custom hook
  --> abstracts implementation from display layer
  ==> update hook if you change implementation
  ==> no need to update components
