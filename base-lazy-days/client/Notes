# React Query in Larger App

- Centralizing fetching indicator / error handling
- refetching data
- integrating auth
- dependent queries
- testing

# Custom Hooks

- In larger app, make custom hook for each type of data
  --> can access from multiple components
  --> no risk of mixing up keys
  --> query function encapsulated in custom hook
  --> abstracts implementation from display layer
  ==> update hook if you change implementation
  ==> no need to update components

We will going to update our app to use a centralized loading indicator instead
of having an individual loading indicator for each component.

For this, we will use a react query hook called useIsFetching.

In smaller apps

- used isFetching from useQuery return object
- Remainder: isLoading is isFetching plus no cached data.

In larger app

- Loading spinner whenever any query isFetching
- We are going to have a centralised loading spinner that's just
  going to be a part of our app component and will turn it on if
  any query is fetching and will turn it off if there aren't any queries.

- useIsFetching will tells us whether there are any queries that are currently
  fetching.

- Thus, no need for isFetching on every custom hook / useQuery call.

===============
passing useQuery errors to Chakra UI "toast" component.

- onError callback to useQuery
- Instead of destructuring isError, error from useQuery return

- onError callback runs if query function throws an error and react query
  passes error parameter to callback.

- will use toast.

======
No useError analogy for useIsFetching

- need more than integer; unclear how to implement

Instead, set default onError handler for queryClient

By default, queryClient takes default either queries or mutations.

{
queries : {useQuery options},
mutations: {useMutation options}
}

Alternative to onError: Error Boundary in react.
To handle react query errors with ErrorBoundary, we can use useErrorBoundary for useQuery

we can either add it in optionto useQuery/ useMutation
or in defaultOptions when creating QueryClient.

If set to true than it propagate errors to the nearest error boundary

===================

# Options for pre-populating data

We want to pre-populate the data if we know what data user needs to see
if there's no data yet in the cache.

==============

# Filtering with the select option

===========

Scenario here : Allow user to filter out any appointments that aren't available.

Why is the select option the best way to do this??

- React Query memo-izes to reduce unnecessary computation.

Under the hood, react query do

- triple equals comparison of select function
- only runs if data changes and the function (select fn) has changed

need a stable function (useCallback for anonymous function)

=========================

setQueryData --> setting data in the cache directly
removeQueries --> removing queries from the cache.

==========

Why not use removeQueries for user data??

- setQueryData invokes onSuccess (removeQueries does not)

===============
Mutations
=============
With mutations, we are going to update the server data.
Because the server data is going to update, we are going to
look at :-

1. Invalidate query on mutation so data is purged from the cache
2. Update cache with data returned from the server after mutation.
   (We will also updaate the cache in circumstances where when we send
   the mutation, we get new data back from the server)
3. Optimistic update (assume mutation will succeed, rollback if not)

# Global Fetching / Error

We will setup a global fetching indicator and error, the same way we did
for queries.

For Errors:
set onError callback in mutations property of query client defaultOptions.

For Loading indicator:
--> useIsMutating is analogous to useIsFetching.But it tells us whether any
of our mutation calls are currently unresolved.

--> Update Loading component to show on isMutating.

===========
useMutation
=========

In useMutation,

- there is no cache data (as its one time thing)
- by default, no retries (but configurable)
- no refetch (as no data associated with it)
- no isLoading vs isFetching distinction

- returns mutate function which actually runs mutation and that we would actually use to run the mutation

- There's also an onMutate callback which we are going to be using for
  optimistic queries.
  We are going to be using that to store what the state was before so that
  we can restore it if mutation fails

  =======
  Typescript: Returnign mutate function
  =======

  Type for returning mutate function from custom hook.

  UseMutateFunction<TData=unknown, TError=unknown, TVariables=void, TContext=unknown>

  TData -> Data type returned by mutation function itself. Example: In our case, mutation function doesn't return any data so we going to set that to void.

  TError -> Error type thrown by mutation function. Example:Error

  TVariables -> mutate function variables type. Example mutate

  TContext -> Context type set in onMutate function for optimistic update rollback. Example:Appointment

======
Invalidating Query After Mutation
======

By default, when we send the data to server by calling mutate function.
It will send the data to server, but in UI side it seems like nothing changed.
That is bad user experience, so instead we want to refetch the data after the
mutation because we are going to assume that the data is out of date.

And we can alert react query that the data is out of date by invalidating the relevant query.

==============
invalidateQueries
============
The queryClient has an invalidate queries method and we are going to use that to invalidate
the cache for our appointments data when we mutate the appointment by reserving it.
So user doesn't have to refresh the page.

invalidateQueries() takes on argument which is query key which this function will invalidate

invalidateQueries effects:

- markes query as stale
- triggers refetch if query currently being rendered i.e if we are showing a component that
  uses the query

  # Flow

  we call mutate then
  in our mutation, we have onSuccessHandler that invalidates the relevant queries.
  and that is going to trigger a refetch of the data so that the data updates for the
  user without having to refresh the page.

  # Query Key Prefixes

  - Goal: invalidate all queries related to appointments on mutation.
    and we can do that with query key prefix.

  - invalidateQueries takes a query key prefix.
    --> invalidateQueries actually takes a prefix and not an exact key. so by setting up
    any queries that are related to each other with the same query prefix, we can invalidate
    all of them at once.

  - if we want to make it exact, there is an option. (can make it exact with { exact: true} option)

  - Other queryClient methods take prefix too (like removeQueries)
